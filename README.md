## User Story
- As a student and Web Dev I want to re-create my Dev Able parking log and make it look and work better so that I can keep a log of my parking experiences on campus.

## Narrative
- The purpose of this app is to log all the date, time, and locations of where I parked my truck before class. This project started midway through January and I have recently came back and worked on it again to improve it with many new things I have learned over the course of the semester.

## Code Samples
- Here is a screenshot and html code snippet of my logs from my <strong>*old*</strong> verison of Able.

```
<ul class="list-group">
  <li id="secondLog" class="list-group-item"> <strong>16 JAN.</strong> 10:15 pulled in spot in visitor lot.
  </li>

  <li class="list-group-item"><strong>14 JAN.</strong> Made the loop at 10:01, parked at Nobles, in office ~10:12. <em>Clear, sunny, chilly day.</em> Spot opened up by time I walked by it
  </li>
</ul>
```
## Examples
- The LinkedIn login is a good example of what I would have liked to do and was used as inspiration. My modal turned out to be slighly different and simplier than this.

- I think it is cool that my improved app turned the logs into cards! Here is an example of the code (w/ link) and a screenshot:
